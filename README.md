# ERC-20 Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio of ERC-20 smart contracts and related projects.  
This repository showcases the tokens and experiments I’ve built while exploring Ethereum and EVM-compatible blockchains.

## 📌 About

I’m passionate about blockchain development and smart contract engineering.  
Here you’ll find a collection of my ERC-20 implementations, utilities, and dApps — from simple tokens to more advanced experiments.

Each project includes:
- Solidity source code
- Deployment or migration scripts
- Tests (where applicable)
- Documentation and contract addresses
